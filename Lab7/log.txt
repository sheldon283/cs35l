My partner for this lab was Christopher Aziz. I first followed the instructions on Piazza
for setup, which are as follows:
1.  I first set up my BeagleBone Board according to the instructions specified on Piazza. So
    I first used Putty to SSH into my BeagleBone using the ip address 192.168.7.2 as the
    host name and "root" as the username

2.  I then connect to the wifi using "connmanctl". I started the connmanctl terminal using:
    sudo connmanctl

3.  Turn on the wifi for your BeagleBone:
    connmanctl> enable wifi
 
4.  Scan all available wifi access points:
    connmanctl> scan wifi
 
5.  List all the discovered access points:
    connmanctl> services
 
6.  Register as the prospective client:
    connmanctl> agent on

7.  After you locate the access point you want to connect to, use the string next to the
    name of the access point as the input to the following command:
    connmanctl> connect wifi_2cf7f1066830_4352333736302d77696669_managed_psk

    This connects to the wifi CR3760-wifi. The password is 3760ClassNet

8.  I then quit the application
    connmanctl> quit

9.  I then update the database of apt-get:
    sudo apt-get update

10. I then install the xauth tool for X11 forwarding support for future SSH connections to 
    my BeagleBone:
    sudo apt-get install xauth

11. I then installed Firefox on the Beaglebone to allow GUI support
    apt-get install firefox-esr-l10n-en-gb

After doing all of this, I begin the actual lab.
13. I first create a public/private key pair using the command:
    ssh-keygen

    I kept all default values

14. I then run the commands:
    sudo useradd -d /home/chris -m chris
    sudo passwd chris

    This creates a directory for Chris named chris in the home directory and sets a password
    for him as well. 

15. I then create a ssh directory in chris's directory to store the authentication keys
    sudo mkdir .ssh
    sudo chown -R chris .ssh
    sudo chmod 700 .ssh

16. We then needed to figure out what our IP addresses are using the command:
    ifconfig

    After figuring out our ip addresses, Chris was able to able to ssh into my Wireless 
    Board using my ip. He also set up a client directory I could ssh into as well.

17. Now I have to ssh into Chris's BeagleBone board. I first copied my public key to the ssh
    folder in my directory in his server:
    ssh-copy-id -i sheldon@128.97.104.92

    
18. We then have to register our private key using the ssh-agent with the command:
    ssh-add
    
    Running this, I was prompted for a password. After entering the password, I don't have 
    need to enter a password anymore when I log in to this server again. 

19. I then ssh into the server:
    ssh sheldon@128.97.104.92

20. We then have to use port forwarding so that I could run a command on the remote host 
    so it displays on my host. I did this by running:
    ssh -X sheldon@128.97.104.92

    The -X option enables X11 forwarding, which allows us to use GUI apps on Linux.
    I then ran:
    xterm
    firefox

    And we noticed that it successfully opened xterm and firefox.

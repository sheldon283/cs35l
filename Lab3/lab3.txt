1.  First we check if our locale value is en_US.UTF-8 by running:
    locale
   
    If it isn't, we export it using the command:
    export LC_ALL='en_US.UTF-8'

2.  Then download the Coreutils7.6 tar file to my directory
    using the command:
    wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-7.6.tar.gz

    Unzip it with the command:	  
    tar -xzvf coreutils-7.6.tar.gz

3.  I then change to the coreutils directory using cd:
    cd coreutils-7.6

4.  We then run the command:
    ./configure --prefix=/u/cs/ugrad/sheldon/cs35l/lab3/coreutils

    This configures all files and installs them into a new directory
    called coreutils in the parent folder of coreutils-7.6.tar.gz

5.  I then ran the commands:
    make
    make install

    This installs coreutils-7.6 onto our computer

6.  I then navigate to the bin of the coreutils directory we created using 
    cd ../coreutils/bin

7.  We then run the ls executable to see what the problem is:
    ./ls -l 

    Looking at the output, we notice that the dates are in the wrong format.
    An example is the following:
    -rwxr-xr-x 1 sheldon csugrad  87216 2017-10-17 17:10 unlink

8.  Now it is time to apply Brady's patch. We first navigate back to the
    coreutils-7.6 directory:
    cd ../../coreutils-7.6

9.  I then used emacs to create patch.diff, a file with Brady's patch copied
    into it. I then ran the command:
    patch -p1 < patch.diff

10. I then run make again. This remakes the src file and applies the patch.
    Now, e navigate to the src file in the coreutils-7.6 directory
    and type the command:
    ./ls -l

    We see that ls -l displays the correct display behavior for the dates.
    Example:
    -rw-r--r-- 1 sheldon csugrad  23091 Sep  1  2009 wc.c
    -rw-r--r-- 1 sheldon csugrad  92528 Oct 20 17:24 wc.o

11. I then create a newfile and oldfile to test the modified and old ls 
    commands on a recently modified file and on a file that's at least
    a year old:

    touch newfile
    touch -t 201505110936.33 oldfile

    touch newfile creates a newfile that was modified
    touch -t artificially marks old file as being more than a year old.
    More specifically, my oldfile was given the attribute of having 
    been last modified on 05/11/2015 at 9:36:33

12. We then run the modified ls and the old ls

    Unmodified command:
    coreutils/bin/ls -l
    
    This outputs:
    -rw-r--r--  1 sheldon csugrad    0 2017-10-20 18:08 newfile
    -rw-r--r--  1 sheldon csugrad    0 2015-05-11 09:36 oldfile

    Modified command:
    coreutils-7.6/src/ls -l    

    This outputs:
    -rw-r--r--  1 sheldon csugrad        0 Oct 20 18:08 newfile
    -rw-r--r--  1 sheldon csugrad        0 May 11  2015 oldfile

    So we know that our coreutils directory had been unmodified and 
    is still outputting the incorrect format, while our modified version
    outputs correctly

1. man -k [search]
   search is the word you want to look for. 
   Using the hint, I looked in the man pages for man to find the answer.

2. /usr/bin/cp
   /usr/bin/wc 
   I ran the commands "which cp" and "which wc".
   This shows us that cp and wc are located in the folders mentioned above.

3. /usr/bin/X - A portable, network transparent window system 
   for bitmap displays
   /usr/bin/w - shows who is logged on and what they are doing
   /usr/bin/[ - Evaluates conditional expressions

   I used the command find/usr/bin -name "?" -executable.
   This outputted the above paths.
   To find what they do, I used the man command (man w, man [, etc).

4. /etc/alternatives/emacs
   I used the command readlink /usr/bin/emacs.

5. g+s sets the group ID on execution on the current directory.  
   o-x: remove permission to execute(or searchh for directories for others
   I found this out using "man chmod".

6. find -mtime 21
   I used the command "man find" and 
   read how to see the last time a file was modified.

7. find / -type d -mtime -21
   The slash "/" symbolizes we are finding at the root, 
   and -type d indicates we are looking for directories.
   -mtime 21 indicates we are trying to find files modified 
   in the last three weeks.

8. 293
   I used the command find /usr/bin -type l -ls | wc -l.

9. libgpg-error.so.0.10.0, modified January 26, 2014
   I used the command ls -lt /usr/lib.
   I found this out by running "man ls" and finding reference to time in them.

10. Using man pages for locale, we see that 
    locale gets its info based on the settings
    of the environment variables that control the locale.

   I found this out using C-h a and searching for sort in Emacs.

C-M-a  beginning-of-defun: Move backward to the beginning of a defun	
C-M-b  backward-sexp: Move backward across one balanced expression (sexp)

C-M-f  forward-sexp: Move forward across one balanced expression (sexp)
C-M-h  mark-defun: Put mark at end of this defun, point at beginning

       I found this using the commands C-h b,
       switching to the help window using C-x o,
       and then searching us C-s for "C-M-a". 
       I then went through each command hyperlink for command descriptions.

13. C-g cancels commands that are unwanted without having to finish it.

14. Yank is basically pasting. 
    It puts text that was killed earlier back into the program.

15. I first navigated to /usr/bin, and then ran the command ls -l.
    I then ran the command C-x d on Emacs on another terminal to run Dired.
    Comparing the two, they look almost identical, 
    except that Dired also gives us the current and parent directory.
    ls -l does not

1.  I first navigated to the original diffutils directory using cd and then checked out v3.0
    of Diffutils into a new branched called "quote" using the command:
    git checkout v3.0 -b quote

2.  I then apply the patch using the command:
    patch -p1 < quote-3.0-patch.txt

3.  I then learned how to use the Emacs function add-change-log-entry-other-window (C-x 4 a)
    I used git status to see my files and then used to emacs to access each one. I then used
    the add-change-log-entry-other-window command to add a ChangeLog entry for my patch

4.  I then add and commit my changes to the new branch using the ChangeLog entry as the 
    commit message using the command:
    git add .
    git commit -F ChangeLog

5.  I then generated a formatted-patch.txt using the command:
    git format-patch -1 --stdout > formatted-patch.txt

6.  My partner for this hw assignment was Christopher Aziz. I first created a new branch
    called partner from the quote branch:
    git checkout -b partner v3.0

7.  I then used my partner's formmatted-patch.txt, called formatted2.txt, and applied it to
    my new branch:
    git am < formatted2.txt
    Applying: 2017-12-04 Lawrence Nelson Lee <lawrencl@lnxsrv07.seas.ucla.edu>
    
    The patch was applied successfully after doing this

8. I then built and ran the followign commands again:
   ./bootstrap
   ./configure
   make
   make check
   make distdir

   This entered the newly created directory diffutils-3.0.1-6fd3 and looked at the ChangeLog
   in this directory. It was exactly the same as my partner's patch, so I could conclude 
   that the patch was successful.

9.  I then navigated to ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs using the command:
    cd ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs

    If I hadn't earlier, I then need to export the PATH using the command:
    export PATH=/usr/local/cs/bin:$PATH

    I then run the command:
    gitk

    However, Iget the following errors:
Application initialization failed: no display name and no $DISPLAY environment
variable
Error in startup script: no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variable
    while executing
"load /usr/lib64/tk8.5/../libtk8.5.so Tk"
    ("package ifneeded Tk 8.5.7" script)
    invoked from within
"package require Tk"
    (file "/usr/local/cs/bin/gitk" line 10)

    This indicates that X11 forwarding is not enabled currently on putty. I then download
    Xming and enable X11 forwarding on putty and repeat the above steps. This time, when
    I run gitk, a new window pops up. Looking through it, we see that the newest merge point
    that is not newer than 2015-01-25 is by Trevor Murphy

    I then took a screenshot and in an ASCII text file called gitk-description.txt, I
    described the roles of subwindows that I see in the screenshot
